# Halogens
*Elements from the sea*

The halogens are the very reactive non-metals of group 7. As elements, they all exist as diatomic molecules and are found in the p-block of the periodic table. Halogens react by gaining/accepting an electron in which they are reduced themselves and known as oxidising agents.

## Properties of halogens

| Halogen | Appearance at RTP |
|---|---|
|Fluorine|Pale yellow gas|
|Chlorine|Pale green gas|
|Bromine|Red-brown liquid|
|Iodine|Shiny grey solid|

|Group 7 element|Halide ions|In aqueous solution|In organic solvent|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cl|Colourless|Very pale green|Pale green|
|Br|Colourless|Orange|Deeper orange|
|I|Colourless|Brown|Purple|

Halogens get less reactive down the group as their atomic radius increases. This means there is more shielding and a greater distance from the positive attraction of the nucleus. The extra electron is not attracted as strongly.

## Displacement reactions

Conversely, the oxidising power of halogens increases up the group as the decreasing atomic radius makes it easier for the halogen atom to accept an electron. A displacement reaction is where one reactant replaces another reactant in a compound. A more reactive halogen will take the place of a less reactive halide in solution. If a reaction takes place, a colour change will be observed as the different halogens in solution have characteristic colours.

||KCl|KBr|KI|
|---|---|---|---|
|Chlorine|No reaction|$\ce{Cl}{_2} + 2\ce{Br}{^-} → \ce{Br}{_2} + 2\ce{Cl}{^-}$<br/>Very pale green to orange|$\ce{Cl}{_2} + 2\ce{I}{^-} → \ce{I}{_2} + 2\ce{Cl}{^-}$<br/>Very pale green to brown|
|Bromine|No reaction|No reaction|$\ce{Br}{_2} + 2\ce{I}{^-} → \ce{I}{_2} + 2\ce{Br}{^-}$<br/>Orange to brown|
|Iodine|No reaction|No reaction|No reaction|

## Precipitation reaction

Silver ions react with halide ions to form precipitates.

1. Add dilute nitric acid to remove ions that might interfere.
2. Add silver nitrate. A precipitate should form.
3. To confirm the halide ion, add dilute or concentrated ammonia.

|Halide|Precipitate|Equation|Add dilute ammonia|
|---|---|---|---|
|Chloride|White| $\ce{Ag}{^+}(aq)+\ce{Cl}{^-}(aq)→\ce{AgCl}(s)$ |Redissolves fully|
|Bromide|Cream| $\ce{Ag}{^+}(aq)+\ce{Br}{^-}(aq)→\ce{AgBr}(s)$ |Redissolves partially|
|Iodide|Pale Yellow| $\ce{Ag}{^+}(aq)+\ce{I}{^-}(aq)→\ce{AgI}(s)$ |Does not redissolve|

## Chlorine

Chlorine has many uses, although it is accompanied by risks. It is toxic and corrosive and should be kept away from eyes and skin. Considering it is a gas, a transport leak could be very dangerous due to the pace at which it could spread. As such, chlorine is often used at the same site at which it is produced. If it needs to be transported, it can be liquefied and put into pressurised tanks.

### Uses of chlorine

* Water treatment: kills germs and pathogens.
* Making HCl, to make certain polymers with Cl in their structures.
* Extract brine from seawater.
* Making bleach.
  * $\ce{Cl}{_2}+2\ce{NaOH}→\ce{NaCl}+\ce{NaClO}+\ce{H{_2}O}$
