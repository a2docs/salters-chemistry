# Atom economy
*Elements from the sea*

Atom economy is a measure of the proportion of reactants that are converted into useful products rather than waste products in the equation. High atom economy means less waste.

$$\ce{Atom economy} = \frac{\ce{M{_r} of useful product}}{\ce{Total M{_r} of all products}}$$

High atom economy is desirable for desirable for industrial chemical processes. This means the process is more economically viable for industrial-scale manufacturing and it helps to preserve raw materials.
