# Redox
*Elements from the sea*

Redox reactions are when electrons are transferred. Oxidation is the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain of electrons - these occur simultaneously. If the oxidation states of the compounds change, a reaction can be considered as redox. Half equations can be used to represent simple oxidation and reduction reactions.

$$2\ce{Cl}{^-}→\ce{Cl}{_2}+2\ce{e}{^-}\quad\quad\ce{(oxidation)}$$

$$\ce{Cu}{^2}+2\ce{e}{^-}→\ce{Cu}\quad\quad\ce{(reduction)}$$

* Oxidising agents cause another thing to be oxidised, and are themselves reduced - they accept electrons.
* Reducing agents cause another thing to be reduced, and are themselves oxidised - they donate electrons.

## Electrolysis

Electrolysis is the process of breaking down a substance using electricity. Because the ions are free to move, ionic compounds can conduct electricity when molten or in solution. The liquid that is to be broken down is the electrolyte. Half-equations can be used to show the movement of electrons and what happens at each electrode.

* Negative ions (anions) move to the positive electrode (anode) and lose electrons.
* Positive ions (cations) move to the negative electrode (cathode) and gain electrons.

### Electrolysis of an aqueous solution

1. Connect each electrode to the power supply.
   * The electrode connected to the positive pole is the anode.
   * The electrode connected to the negative pole is the cathode.
   * Inert electrodes are typically used to prevent their reaction in the electrolysis.
1. Place the electrodes in a beaker with the electrolyte, ensuring they don't touch.
1. Turn on the power supply.
1. Products will form as metals on the surface of the cathode (plating) or as gases at either electrode.
