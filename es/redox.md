# Redox
*Elements from the sea*

Redox reactions are when electrons are transferred. Oxidation is the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain of electrons - these occur simultaneously. If the oxidation states of the compounds change, a reaction can be considered as redox. Half equations can be used to represent simple oxidation and reduction reactions.

$$2\ce{Cl}{^-}→\ce{Cl}{_2}+2\ce{e}{^-}\quad\quad\ce{(oxidation)}$$

$$\ce{Cu}{^2}+2\ce{e}{^-}→\ce{Cu}\quad\quad\ce{(reduction)}$$

* Oxidising agents cause another thing to be oxidised, and are themselves reduced - they accept electrons.
* Reducing agents cause another thing to be reduced, and are themselves oxidised - they donate electrons.

## Electrolysis

Electrolysis is the process of breaking down a substance using electricity. Because the ions are free to move, ionic compounds can conduct electricity when molten or in solution. The liquid that is to be broken down is the electrolyte. Half-equations can be used to show the movement of electrons and what happens at each electrode.

* Negative ions (anions) move to the positive electrode (anode) and lose electrons.
* Positive ions (cations) move to the negative electrode (cathode) and gain electrons.

### Electrolysis of an aqueous solution

1. Connect each electrode to the power supply.
   * The electrode connected to the positive pole is the anode.
   * The electrode connected to the negative pole is the cathode.
   * Inert electrodes are typically used to prevent their reaction in the electrolysis.
1. Place the electrodes in a beaker with the electrolyte, ensuring they don't touch.
1. Turn on the power supply.
1. Products will form as metals on the surface of the cathode (plating) or as gases at either electrode.

### Reactions in electrolysis

#### Molten compounds
* Only one type of cation and anion is present.
* At the cathode, the positive ions are reduced and gain electrons to give the element.
  * $\ce{X}{^+}+\ce{e}{^-}→\ce{X}$
* At the anode, the negative ions are oxidised and lose electrons to give the element.
  * $2\ce{X}{^-}→\ce{X}{_2}+2\ce{e}{^-}$

#### Aqueous solutions
* Ions from the ionic compound are present, as well as the ions from water.
* At the cathode, cations of the more reactive metal (group 1, 2, and Al) stay as ions and hydrogen ions react instead. Cations of the less reactive metals do react.
  * $2\ce{H}{^+}+2\ce{e}{^-}→\ce{H}{_2}$
* At the anode, halide ions react if they are present. Otherwise, hydroxide ions from water react in preference to other anions to give oxygen.
  * $4\ce{OH}{^-}→\ce{O}{_2}+2\ce{H{_2}O}+4\ce{e}{^-}$

### Metal electrodes

Metals can be purified by electrolysing a solution of their ions with electrodes of that metal. The concentration of the metal in solution will remain the same, because each ion taken by the cathode is replaced by a new one from the anode. The electrons balance.

* The anode is the impure metal and it will gradually go into the solution.
* The cathode will gradually grow as the pure metal builds up there.

### Production of halogens

Most halogens can be made by the electrolysis of halide solutions, as the element is released at the anode.

* Chlorine can be extracted by the electrolysis of brine. Brine is a solution of water with a high concentration of salts (NaCl) and occurs naturally. The electrodes are made of inert material and the cell is constantly fed with a fresh stream of brine.
* Bromine and iodine can be produced in a displacement reaction with chlorine. Chlorine is more reactive than bromine, so the chlorine will displace it and the bromine can be collected.

## Oxidation states

Oxidation states indicate how many electrons an atom has and can be used to determine how many electrons an atom has donated to or accepted from an ion or bond. Roman numerals indicate the oxidation state on the element if it can have multiple oxidation states.

| Element                        | Oxidation state |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| Group 1 metals                 | +1              |
| Group 2 metals                 | +2              |
| Oxygen                         | -2, usually     |
| Hydrogen                       | +1, usually     |
| Fluorine                       | -1              |
| Oxygen, with fluorine          | +2              |
| Oxygen, in perodides           | -1              |

After oxidation states have been assigned to all the atoms in the equation, they can be used to balance it.

* Multiply the oxidation and reduction equations by the appropriate coefficients so that both contain the same number of electrons.
* Add the two half equations and cancel the electrons.
* Balance the charge by adding hydrogen or hydroxide ions as necessary.
* Balance the oxygen atoms by adding water molecules to one side of the equation.
* Check to make sure that the equation is balanced in both atoms and total charges.

## Sodium-thiosulfate titrations

Sodium-thiosulfate titrations can be used to find the concentration of an oxidising agent. The more concentrated it is, the more ions will be oxidised by a certain volume of it. The process of finding the concentration of chlorate(I) ions in bleach is as follows:

* Use a pipette to accurately measure a fixed volume of chlorate(I) ions containing bleach solution into a conical flask.
* Add a solution containing iodide ions in excess, such as potassium iodide solid, and excess sulfuric acid (to provide hydrogen ions) to the conical flask. The chlorate(I) ion readily oxidises the iodide ions to iodine. All the chlorate(I) ions will react, but some iodide ions will be left over.
  * $\ce{ClO}{^-}+2\ce{I}{^-}+2\ce{H}{^+}→\ce{I}{_2}+\ce{Cl}{^-}+\ce{H{_2}O}$
* Add a sodium thiosulfate solution of known concentration from a burette.
* Titrate the diluted bleach solution with the sodium thiosulfate solution. The thiosulfate ions will react with the iodine produced from before.
  * $\ce{I{_2}}+\ce{2S{_2}O{_3}}{^{2-}}→\ce{2I}{^-}+\ce{S{_4}O{_6}}{^{2-}}$
* The solution will fade to straw yellow as iodine reacts. Then, add a few drops of starch solution. This will give a deep blue-black colour as iodine is still present.
* Continue adding the thiosulfate solution while swirling until the blue-black colour disappears and the solution turns colourless. This is the end point when all the iodine has reacted.
* Repeat this until the titres are concordant. Find the average titre and use this to find the concentration of chlorate(I) ions

### Considerations

* Using contaminated apparatus could make the results inaccurate - ensure the burette is very clean by rinsing it with the thiosulfate solution before starting.
* Read the burette from the bottom of the meniscus.
* Repeat the experiment to get concordant results and use the average.
* Wash the flask between experiments
* If the starch is added too soon, the iodine will bind with the starch and will not react as expected with the thiosulfate. The results will be unreliable.
* The solutions react very slowly with oxygen in the air and so they should be as fresh as possible.

## Nomenclature

Systematic nomenclature can be used to name and interpret the names of inorganic compounds.

* The name of the positive ion comes first.
* The name of the negative ion comes last.
* Names of ions ending in -ate means the ion contains oxygen and another element.
* Roman numerals are given after the name of the -ate compound if the non-oxygen element can exist with different oxidation states.
