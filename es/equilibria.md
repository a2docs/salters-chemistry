## Chemical equilibria

Some reactions are reversible: the products of the reaction can react together to re-form the original reactants. For example, nitrogen and hydrogen form ammonia if they are mixed under the right conditions. However, some of the ammonia reacts back to produce nitrogen and hydrogen.

$$\ce{N}{_2}\,_{(g)} + 3\ce{H}{_2}\,_{(g)}⇌2\ce{NH}{_3}\,_{(g)}$$

Eventually, a point is reached where the rate of the reverse reaction is equal to the rate of the forward reaction. The mixture is now said to be at equilibrium.

### Dynamic equilibria

* The forward and reverse reactions are both happening, but at the same **rate**.
* The concentrations of the reactants and products remain **constant**.

> A dynamic equilibrium can only occur in a **closed system**. No matter can enter or exit the system: if product was escaping then it wouldn't react back again.

Left: equilibrium lies towards the products (RHS). Right: equilibrium lies towards the reactants (LHS).

## Position of equilibrium

> **Le Chatelier's principle** states that if a reaction at equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, the position of equilibrium will shift in the direction that minimises the change.

### Changing the pressure

Increasing the pressure shifts the equilibrium in the direction with fewest gas molecules to minimise the change. Decreasing the pressure shifts the equilibrium in the direction with the most gas molecules.

### Changing the temperature

Increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium in the endothermic direction to minimise the change. Decreasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium in the exothermic direction.

### Adding a catalyst

Catalysts do not change the position of equilibrium. The catalyst increases the rate of both the forward and reverse reactions equally. However, the reaction will reach equilibrium quicker.

## Equilibrium constant

The equilibrium constant, $K_c$, indicates the position of equilibrium in a reversible reaction at a certain temperature. It is not affected by changes in pressure or concentration. When a condition is changed, equilibrium is only achieved again when its position shifts in the direction that restores $K_c$.

$$a\ce{A}+b\ce{B}→c\ce{C}+d\ce{D}\quad\quad\quad\ce{K_c} = \frac{[D]{^d}[C]{^c}}{[A]{^a}[B]{^b}}$$

### $K_c$ values

The position of equilibrium can be estimated by the magnitude of the value of Kc.

* If Kc >> 1, equilibrium lies far right. The reaction appears to have gone to completion (greater than 10^10).
* If Kc > 1, equalibrium lies right. There are more products than reactants.
* If Kc = 1, equilibrium lies in the middle. There is an equal amount of products and reactants at equilibrium.
* If Kc < 1, equilibrium lies left. There are more reactants than products.
* If Kc << 1, equilibrium lies far left. The reaction appears not to have happened (less than 10^-10).
