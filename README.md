# A-level Chemistry

Welcome. This is a revision resource for OCR's A-level Chemistry (Salters) course, with notes covering each section of the subject. Eventually, we hope to offer comprehensive coverage of the whole A-level specification. In the meantime, you can contribute by improving pages [here](https://github.com/a2docs/salters-chemistry).

> Given this is a public resource that anyone can edit, please note there is no guarantee of validity. You are encouraged to cross-check information with other sources, such as OCR-endorsed or reputable textbooks, and to correct any false information if you can.
