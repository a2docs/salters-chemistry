## Infrared spectroscopy

Infrared radiation increases a molecule's vibrational energy level. Specific frequencies of infrared radiation make specific bonds in organic molecules vibrate. This enables us to identify the bonds in an organic compound and therefore the functional groups present.

Frequency is measured in wavenumber ($cm^{-1}$). Peaks come down the paper. Refer to the following bonds.
