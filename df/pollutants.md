# Pollutants
*Developing fuels*

## Atmospheric pollutants

The atmospheric pollutants you need to know about include:
* Carbon dioxide (CO2)
* Carbon monoxide (CO)
* Particulates
* Unburnt hydrocarbons
* Nitrous oxides (NOx)
* Sulfur oxides (SOx)

### Origin

|Pollutant|Origin|
|---|---|
|Carbon dioxide (CO2)|Complete combustion of hydrocarbon (or alcohol) fuels.|
|Carbon monoxide (CO)|Incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon (or alcohol) fuels.|
|Particulates|Very small carbon particles produced by incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels.|
|Unburnt hydrocarbons|Unburnt fuel.|
|Nitrous oxides (NOx)|O2 and N2 (from the air) react together in the intense heat of the engine, producing NO.|
|Sulfur oxides (SOx)|Sulfur compounds in fuel combine with oxygen in the air in the heat of the engine.|

### Environmental implications

|Pollutant|Origin|
|---|---|
|Carbon dioxide (CO2)|It is a greenhouse gas; it contributes to global warming.|
|Carbon monoxide (CO)|It is toxic; it contributes to the formation of photochemical smog.|
|Particulates|It causes irritation of the lungs.|
|Unburnt hydrocarbons|It contributes to the formation of photochemical smog.|
|Nitrous oxides (NOx)|It is acidic and can cause acid rain; it contributes to the formation of photochemical smog.|
|Sulfur oxides (SOx)|It is acidic and can cause acid rain.|

Using catalysts to speed up reactions that involve pollutants is beneficial. The products of the following reactions are all naturally present in the air:

1. Using oxygen to turn carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide.
2. Using oxygen to turn hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water.
3. Reacting nitrogen dioxide with carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and nitrogen.

These reactions occur naturally, but they are too slow to remove the pollutants under the conditions inside an exhaust system.

## Alternative fuels

The following are alternative fuels to petrol:

|Alternative|Sustainable?|Benefits|Risks|
|---|---|---|---|
|Diesel|No|Less CO|More NOx and particulates.|
|LPG|No|Less CO, CO2, NOx, hydrocarbons.|Needs to be stored under pressure to liquify.|
|Ethanol|Yes, but energy is needed for its cultivation.|High octane number. Less CO, SOx, NOx.|Flammable and intoxicating.|
|Biodiesel|Yes, from plants.|Plants absorb CO2. Biodegradable. Less CO, hydrocarbons, and particulates.|Higher NOx emissions.|
|Hydrogen|Yes, if made with solar cells.|Water is the only product of its combustion.|Highly flammable. Needs to be stored under high pressure to liquify.|
