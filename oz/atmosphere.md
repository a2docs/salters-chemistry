# Chemistry of the atmosphere
*The ozone story*

## Ozone
Ozone is constantly being destroyed and formed in the atmosphere - these are typically radical reactions.

* Formation of ozone
  * $\ce{O_2}+\ce{h\mathit{v}}→\ce{2O}$
  * $\ce{O}+\ce{O_2}→\ce{O_3}$
* Destruction of ozone
  * $\ce{O_3}+\ce{h\mathit{v}}→\ce{O_2}+\ce{O}$
  * $\ce{O}+\ce{O_3}→\ce{2O_2}$

The destruction of ozone is catalysed by $\ce{Cl}$ radicals from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

### Carbofluorocarbons

1. $\ce{Cl}+\ce{O_3}→\ce{ClO}+\ce{O_2}$
    * Cl is the catalyst and ClO is the intermediate.
2. $\ce{ClO}+\ce{O}→\ce{Cl}+\ce{O_2}$
    * The intermediate is used and the catalyst is regenerated.

The overall reaction is $\ce{O_3} + \ce{O} → \ce{2O_2}$.

CFCs were widely used as refridgerants and aerosol spray propellants. They were used in this way because they are non-toxic, unreactive, and non-flammable. Being volatile and having a high enthalpy of vapourisation made them good refridgerants.

CFCs are unreactive in the troposphere, but high energy UV radiation in the stratosphere causes photodissociation. The $\ce{C}-\ce{Cl}$ bonds break by homolytic fission. The $\ce{C}-\ce{F}$ bond does not break because it is shorter (and therefore stronger) and the UV does not have enough energy to break it.

### Other halogen radicals

Other halogen radicals also act as catalysts in the destruction of ozone.

A small proportion of these come from the breakdown of $\ce{CH_{3}Cl}$ and $\ce{CH_{3}Br}$. These are released from the oceans and burning vegetation. High energy UV in the stratosphere causes photodissociation, releasing the halogen radicals.

The halogen-carbon bond breaks rather than the $\ce{C}-\ce{C}$ or $\ce{C}-\ce{H}$ bond because it has a lower bond enthalpy.

### Effects of ozone

In the stratosphere, the presence of ozone is beneficial. It absorbs harmful UV radiation from the sun. This protects against crop damage, skin damage and cancer, and eye damage.

However, the presence of ozone is not beneficial in the troposphere (this is caused by the photodissociation of $\ce{NO_x}$). This is because it is toxic and contributes to the formation of photochemical smog.

## The atmosphere

The atmosphere is composed of:

* 78% nitrogen
* 21% oxygen
* 1% argon
* 350ppm carbon dioxide

### Converting between % and ppm

To convert from ppm to %, divide by 10,000.

To convert from % to ppm, multiply by 10,000.

### Principal radiations

Different energy levels are affected by radiation of different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

|Change occurring|Size of energy change / $J$|Type of radiation absorbed|
|---|---|---|
|Change of rotational energy level|$1\times10^{-22}$ to $1\times10^{-20}$|Microwave|
|Change in vibrational energy level|$1\times10^{-20}$ to $1\times10^{-19}$|Infrared|
|Change in electronic energy level|$1\times10^{-19}$ to $1\times10^{-16}$|Visible and ultraviolet|

When a molecule absorbs ultraviolet radiation, one of three things can happen depending on the amount of energy involved:

* Electrons may be excited to a higher energy level. Later the electrons fall back to a lower energy level and nothing permanent has happened.

* If higher energy radiation is used then the molecule may absorb so much energy that the bonding electrons can no longer bond the atoms together. The two atoms in the molecule break apart and this is known as photodissociation because it is caused by light. As a result, radicals are formed.

* With very high energy photons, the molecules may acquire so much energy that an electron is able to leave it - this is called ionisation.

## Reactions

With data, you can calculate for frequency, wavelength, and energy of electromagnetic radiation.

* $\ce{E}=\ce{h\mathit{v}}$
* $\ce{c}=\ce{λ\mathit{v}}$
