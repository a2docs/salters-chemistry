# Chemistry of the atmosphere
*The ozone story*

## Ozone
Ozone is constantly being destroyed and formed in the atmosphere - these are typically radical reactions.

* Formation of ozone
  * $\ce{O_2}+\ce{h\mathit{v}}→\ce{2O}$
  * $\ce{O}+\ce{O_2}→\ce{O_3}$
* Destruction of ozone
  * $\ce{O_3}+\ce{h\mathit{v}}→\ce{O_2}+\ce{O}$
  * $\ce{O}+\ce{O_3}→\ce{2O_2}$

The destruction of ozone is catalysed by $\ce{Cl}$ radicals from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

### Carbofluorocarbons

1. $\ce{Cl}+\ce{O_3}→\ce{ClO}+\ce{O_2}$
    * Cl is the catalyst and ClO is the intermediate.
2. $\ce{ClO}+\ce{O}→\ce{Cl}+\ce{O_2}$
    * The intermediate is used and the catalyst is regenerated.

The overall reaction is $\ce{O_3} + \ce{O} → \ce{2O_2}$.

CFCs were widely used as refridgerants and aerosol spray propellants. They were used in this way because they are non-toxic, unreactive, and non-flammable. Being volatile and having a high enthalpy of vapourisation made them good refridgerants.

CFCs are unreactive in the troposphere, but high energy UV radiation in the stratosphere causes photodissociation. The $\ce{C}-\ce{Cl}$ bonds break by homolytic fission. The $\ce{C}-\ce{F}$ bond does not break because it is shorter (and therefore stronger) and the UV does not have enough energy to break it.

### Other halogen radicals

Other halogen radicals also act as catalysts in the destruction of ozone.

A small proportion of these come from the breakdown of $\ce{CH_{3}Cl}$ and $\ce{CH_{3}Br}$. These are released from the oceans and burning vegetation. High energy UV in the stratosphere causes photodissociation, releasing the halogen radicals.

The halogen-carbon bond breaks rather than the $\ce{C}-\ce{C}$ or $\ce{C}-\ce{H}$ bond because it has a lower bond enthalpy.

### Effects of ozone

In the stratosphere, the presence of ozone is beneficial. It absorbs harmful UV radiation from the sun. This protects against crop damage, skin damage and cancer, and eye damage.

However, the presence of ozone is not beneficial in the troposphere (this is caused by the photodissociation of $\ce{NO_x}$). This is because it is toxic and contributes to the formation of photochemical smog.

## The atmosphere

The atmosphere is composed of:

* 78% nitrogen
* 21% oxygen
* 1% argon
* 350ppm carbon dioxide

### Converting between % and ppm

To convert from ppm to %, divide by 10,000.

To convert from % to ppm, multiply by 10,000.

### Principal radiations

Different energy levels are affected by radiation of different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
