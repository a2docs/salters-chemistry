## Electronegativity

A covalent bond is a shared pair of electrons. However, these electrons are not shared evenly. Some atoms have a stronger pull on them than others. That is to say, they are more electronegative.

> Electronegativity is the power of an atom to attract the bonding electrons in a covalent bond to itself.

The four most electronegative elements are:
* F: 4.0
* O: 3.5
* N, Cl: 3.0

### Trends in electronegativity

#### Electronegativity increases across a period

Each atom has one more proton in its nucleus. There are also extra electrons, however they are going into the same shell and do not shield each other from the additional positive charge in the nucleus. The nucleus is able to attract the bonding electrons more strongly.

#### Electronegativity decreases down a group

Down the group, each atom has one more shell of electrons. The bonding electrons are further from the nucleus and more shielded from its positive charge. Therefore, they are attracted less by the nucleus, despite there being more protons.

## Polar covalent bonds

|Purely ionic|Polar covalent|Purely covalent|
|---|---|---|
|Complete electron transfer|Electrons shared unevenly|Electrons shared evenly|
|Very big difference in electronegativity|Slight difference in electronegativity|Same electronegativity|
|E.g. $\ce{CsF}$|E.g. $\ce{H_{2}O}$|E.g. $\ce{Cl_2}$|

Polar covalent bonds are covalent bonds where the electron pair is unevenly shared as the two bonding atoms are not equal in electronegativity.

### Example: $\ce{H}-\ce{Cl}$

Cl is more electronegative than H so it has a stronger pull on the shared electrons. This makes the bond polar. The chlorine becomes partially negative ($δ^-$) and the H is partially positive ($δ^+$).

$\ce{H}-\ce{Cl}$<br>$δ^+\quadδ^-$

This is a covalent bond, but it has some *ionic character*. This is because the electrons are not evenly shared - they are starting to be transferred. It is called a polar covalent bond.

### How polar is a bond?

A covalent bond will be polar if the two bonded atoms are different in electronegativity. The greater the difference, the more polar the bond.

### Dipoles

> A dipole is a difference in charge between two atoms caused by a shift in electron density in the bond.

Some molecules contain polar bonds but are non-polar overall. This happens if the bonds are arranged symmetrically so the dipoles cancel.

$\ce{C}=\ce{O}=\ce{C}$<br>$δ^-\quadδ^+\quadδ^-$

## Intermolecular bonds

Weak forces holding simple molecules together are called intermolecular forces. They are broken when heat is applied, causing a state change. There are no intermolecular forces in substances with ionic or metallic bonding or in giant covalent lattices.

For a substance to boil there must be enough energy to overcome the intermolecular bonds and separate the molecules - the stronger the intermolecular bonds, the higher the boiling point.

### Instantaneous dipole - induced dipole bonds

IDIDs exist between all molecules.

1. Moving electrons may instantaneously cause an uneven distribution of charge (instantaneous dipole).
2. The electrons in the neighbouring molecules are repelled creating an induced dipole.
3. The two molecules now attract.

#### Factors affecting strength of IDIDs

1. Size of molecule.
    * More electrons = stronger IDIDs
2. Shape of molecule.
    * More linear = stronger IDIDs (molecules get closer together)

### Permanent dipole - permanent dipole bonds

PDPDs exist between two polar molecules.

1. The partially positive part of one molecule is attracted to the partially negative part of another molecule.
2. The partial charges cause weak electrostatic forces of attraction between the molecules.

### Hydrogen bonding

Hydrogen bonding occurs when H is directly bonding to F/O/N. These are stronger PDPD forces and there must be a small, highly electronegative atom with a lone pair.

1. The F/O/N is more electronegative than H so has a stronger pull on the shared electron.
2. This leaves H as very partially positive.
3. The partially positive H attracts the partially positive F/O/N lone pair of a neighbouring molecule very strongly.

#### Properties of hydrogen bonding

* Molecules with hydrogen bonds dissolve well in water as they compensate with more hydrogen bonds.
* Ice is less dense than water because the molecules are held by permanent hydrogen bonds compared to the bonds constantly breaking and reforming in liquid.
