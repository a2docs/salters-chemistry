# Kinetics
*The ozone story*

> **Activation enthalpy** ($E_a$) is the minimum energy required by a pair of colliding particles for the collision to result in a reaction.

An enthalpy profile is a diagram representing the enthalpy changes that take place during a chemical reaction. They can be used to determine whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. The overall enthalpy change can be calculated by measuring from the reactants to the products. If this is positive, the reaction is endothermic - otherwise, it is exothermic.

## Rate of reaction

For particles to react they must collide with enough energy for bonds to start breaking and a reaction to occur.

### Factors affecting rate of reaction

* **Increasing concentration**
  * Rate of reaction increases.
  * Particles are closer together.
  * There are more collisions - more chances to react.

* **Increasing pressure**
  * Rate of reaction increases.
  * Particles are closer together.
  * There are more collisions - more chances to react.

* **Adding a catalyst**
  * Rate of reaction increases.
  * Alternative reaction pathway with lower $E_a$ provided.
  * More particles will have enough energy to react.

* **Increasing temperature**
  * Rate of reaction increases.
  * Particles have more kinetic energy - more frequent collisions.
  * Higher proportion of particles have a total energy at or above $E_a$.

### Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves

Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves can be used to explain the qualitative effects of temperature changes and catalysts on rate of reaction. Using a catalyst is shown on the left. Increasing temperature is shown on the right.

When a catalyst is added, the activation energy of a reaction decreases. Therefore, the proportion of particles with at least this much energy increases (see shaded areas). When the temperature is increased, the proportion of particles with kinetic energies greater than the activation increases.

### Measuring rate of reaction

Rate of reaction can be measured with various methods.

* Graph of concentration plotted against time (gradient of a tangent shows the rate of reaction at a given time).

* Measure temperature change (and plot this on a graph against time).
* Take samples and titrate at regular intervals.
* Measure mass lost or volume of gas given.
* Measure changes in pH.
* Colorimetry.

## Homogenous catalysis

A homogenous catalyst is in the same physical state as the reactants.

1. The reactant molecules react with the catalyst to form intermediates.
2. The intermediate reacts with another reactant to regenerate the catalyst.

For example, $\ce{O_3} + \ce{O} → \ce{2O_2}$ can be catalysed by chlorine (Cl) atoms.

1. $\ce{Cl}+\ce{O_3}→\ce{ClO}+\ce{O_2}$
    * Cl is the catalyst and ClO is the intermediate.
2. $\ce{ClO}+\ce{O}→\ce{Cl}+\ce{O_2}$
    * The intermediate is used and the catalyst is regenerated.

Note that there can be more than one intermediate in homogenous catalysis.
