## Reactions of radicals

Radicals are particles with an unpaired electron. Reactions involving radicals are often chain reactions and occur in three stages.

In the dark there is no reaction. However, there is UV present in sunlight so there is an explosion. The mechanism for this reaction is called radical substitution.

Methane + chlorine can be used as an example. $\ce{CH_4}+\ce{Cl_2}→\ce{CH_{3}Cl}+\ce{HCl}$

### I. Initiation
*Radicals are first produced*

The UV provides the energy needed for the $\ce{Cl}-\ce{Cl}$ bond in some of the $\ce{Cl_2}$ to break (homolytic fission). This is called photodissociation.

$\ce{Cl2}→\ce{2Cl}\bullet$

### II. Propagation
*Radicals produce more radicals*

First, the chlorine radical takes a $\ce{H}$ atom from the methane molecule, leaving a methyl radical.

The methyl radical produced is itself extremely reactive. It reacts by taking a $\ce{Cl}$ atom from one of the many chlorine molecules still around. This regenerates a chlorine radical, which will attack another methane molecule.

$$\ce{Cl}\bullet+\ce{CH_{4}}→\ce{HCl}+\ce{CH_{3}}\bullet$$

$$\ce{CH_{3}}\bullet+\ce{Cl_2}→\ce{Cl}\bullet+\ce{CH_{3}Cl}$$

These two propagation steps happen repeatedly to continue the chain reaction until termination.

### III. Termination
*Radicals combine to produce a stable molecule*

If two radicals collide then they will react together. The activation enthalpy for a termination step is very low as no bonds need to be broken.

$$\ce{2Cl}\bullet→\ce{Cl_2}$$

$$\ce{2CH_3}\bullet→\ce{C_{2}H_{6}}$$

$$\ce{CH_3}\bullet+\ce{Cl}\bullet→\ce{CH_{3}Cl}$$

## Reactions of haloalkanes
When haloalkanes react, the $\ce{C}-\ce{X}$ bond breaks. This can happen in two ways.

1. In the stratosphere, high energy UV from the sun breaks the bond by homolytic fission to give radicals.
    * $\ce{CH_{3}Cl}→\ce{CH_3}\bullet+\ce{Cl}\bullet$
2. More often, substitution reactions involving heterolytic fission of the bond occur.

### Substitution reactions

The $\ce{C}-\ce{X}$ bond is polar. This is because halogen atoms are more electronegative than carbon atoms. The partial positive charge on the carbon attracts nucleophiles.

> A nucleophile is a species with a lone pair of electrons. It donates the lone pair to a partially positive carbon to form a new covalent bond.

Nucleophiles will themselves be negatively charged or have a partially negative atom with the lone pair. It forms a new bond to the partially positive carbon of the haloalkane. However, one of the current bonds has to break because carbons can only have four bonds.

$$\ce{CH_{3}Cl} + \ce{:Nuc^-}→\ce{CH_{3}Nuc}+\ce{Cl^-}$$

> Substitution reactions are where one atom or group in a molecule gets replaced by another atom or group.

This process is called nucleophilic substitution.

#### Reaction with $\ce{OH^-}$ ions (hydrolysis)

|Reagents|Conditions|
|---|---|
|$\ce{NaOH}$, provides the $\ce{OH^-}$|Heat under reflux|

> Reflux is where a liquid reaction mixture is boiled in a flask connected to a vertical condenser. This is used when the mixture needs heating for a while as it prevents loss of reactants and products as vapour. The compounds continuously evaporate and then condense and drip back into the flask.

$$\ce{C_{2}H_{5}Br}+\ce{OH^-}→\ce{C_{2}H_{5}OH}+\ce{Br^-}$$

#### Reaction with water

Water can act as a nucleophile if the oxygen has a lone pair of electrons it can donate and is partially negative. However, it is a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide ions because water does not have a full negative charge. So, the reaction is very slow.

$$\ce{C_{2}H_{5}Br}+\ce{H_{2}O}→\ce{C_{2}H_{6}OH}+\ce{HBr}$$

#### Reaction with ammonia

|Reagents|Conditions|
|---|---|
|Concentrated ammonia solution|Heat in a sealed tube|

Ammonia is another nucleophile without a full negative charge. So, vigorous conditions are needed for this reaction. The mechanism is similar to the water reaction.

$$\ce{C_{2}H_{5}Br}+\ce{NH_3}→\ce{C_{2}H_{6}NH_{2}}+\ce{HBr}$$

## Reactivity of haloalkanes

Depending on the halogen, different haloalkanes can undergo these reactions at different rates.

* The carbon-halogen bond gets less polar down the group because the halogen atom gets less electronegative. This makes the carbon atom less partially positive so the nucleophile will be slower to attack.
* The bond strength of the carbon-halogen bond decreases down the group because the atomic radius increases. The larger the bonding atoms, the further away the bonding electrons are from the nucleus - there is a weaker attraction. This bond has to break when the nucleophile attacks, and this bond breaking process gets easier and faster down the groups.

Experiments show that the second factor is more important.

### Experiment with silver nitrate

Silver nitrate solution gives an immediate precipitate if added to a solution containing chloride, bromide, or iodide. Adding silver nitrate to a haloalkane will not give a precipitate straight away - the haloalkane must first react with the nucleophile present (water in the silver nitrate solution) before halide ions are present.

We will see a precipitate appear after the haloalkane reacts with the nucleophile present by nucleophilic substitution. The idea is to add silver nitrate solution to different haloalkanes and time how long it takes for the precipitate to appear.

A sample of each haloalkane is put in a test tube with some ethanol. All three test tubes are put in the same water bath until they reach 50 degrees Celsius. Then, the silver nitrate solution can be added to all three test tubes at the same time. The stopwatch should be started at this time and the length of time for the precipitate to appear in each tube should be noted.

|Position|Precipitate|Colour|
|---|---|---|
|$\ce{1^{st}}$|$\ce{AgI}$|Pale Yellow|
|$\ce{2^{nd}}$|$\ce{AgBr}$|Cream|
|$\ce{3^{rd}}$|$\ce{AgCl}$|White|

#### Considerations

* Haloalkanes that are liquid at room temperature need to be used. Halobutanes are typically used.
* Haloalkanes are immiscible in water. Ethanol is used as a mutual solvent for the haloalkane, water, and silver ions.
* All three haloalkane reactions must take place at the same temperature.

## Homolytic and heterolytic fission

Homolytic fission is where each bonding atom receives one electron from the bonded pair (same outcome). Two uncharged radicals are formed.

Heterolytic fission is where one bonding atom receives both electrons from the bonded pair (different outcomes). A positively charged cation and a negatively charged anion are formed.
